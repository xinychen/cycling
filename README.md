Understanding urban mobility patterns of cycling with bikeshare data.

<br>

## Content

1. **Processing open data from some bikeshare systems**, e.g., [Bixi (Montreal)](https://bixi.com/en/open-data), [Citi Bike (NYC)](https://ride.citibikenyc.com/system-data), [Mobi (Vancouver)](https://www.mobibikes.ca/en/system-data).
2. **Identifying mobility pattern changes in COVID-19** (e.g., overall decrease in car traffic, assessment of mobility preference over cycling and other transport modes, recognition of bike commuting, evidence of cycling duration and distance changes).
